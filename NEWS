Wanderlust NEWS -- User-visible changes in Wanderlust. 10 May 2000
* Changes in 2.4.0 from 1.1.1.

** Version Number
The version numbering convention for Wanderlust is changed. 

In earlier versions, 1.x were stable version and from 2.0.x to 2.2.x
were beta version. But since version 2.3.0, the second (minor) version
number implies the stability of the Wanderlust. Even minor number
corresponds to a stable version, and an odd minor number corresponds
to a development version. This version numbering is based on the
widespread convention of open source development.

On the open CVS server cvs.m17n.org, main trunk contains the current
beta (newest experimental) version, and branches contain the stable
version.  (If the version is 2.4.x, the branch name is wl-2_4)

** Install

*** FLIM 1.12 is not supported anymore.
See the file INSTALL for details.

*** APEL 10.2 or later is required.
tm-8 users should check the version of APEL (tm-8.8 contains old APEL).

** New feature

*** LDAP support
Complete e-mail address in draft by searching LDAP server.
If the variable wl-use-ldap is non-nil, LDAP feature is enabled
(Initial setting is nil).

*** UIDL support in POP3 folder
POP3 folder now saves the status of summary and it improves summary
update speed. If the variable elmo-pop3-use-uidl is non-nil, UIDL is
used (Initial setting is t).

*** Emacs 21 support
Wanderlust has started on supporting Standard Emacs 21.
Toolbars and icon images can be shown in almost Wanderlust
frames like XEmacs.

*** biff feature
Server mailbox is checked periodically.
If new mail is arrived, Wanderlust changes the biff (icon) on the modeline
and updates folder mode content.

*** expire-hide 
Now expire mechanism has new feature `hide', it does not remove
messages actually from folder but hides messages from summary. It
improves processing speed for large folders.

*** Message thread restoring feature
Automatic correction of broken threads by subject matching is now available.
Thread modification by hand (M-w (copy) and C-y (paste) in summary mode)
is also available.

*** Password expiration timer
Password cache expires after elmo-passwd-life-time is passed.
(nil means no expiration. Initial setting is nil)

*** killed-list
Deleted messages in the NNTP folder are saved to `killed-list'.  The
messages in the killed-list are treated as if it were not exist on the
server. Non-nil value for elmo-use-killed-list enables this feature
(Initial setting is t). By this feature, NNTP pipe folder works correctly.

*** Maildir pack is now available
M-x wl-summary-pack-number in the summary mode of Maildir folder
re-numbers the messages.

** Searching

*** Complex condition can be specified for filter folder
AND condition, OR condition, NOT condition, and their combination can be
 specified. Syntax of the condition part is changed. See info for details.

Caution for those who upgrade from 1.1.1:
By this change, saving directory for the msgdb of filter folder is altered.
Former msgdbs are not needed anymore. It does not cause any problem but
if you don't want to keep useless disk, you should remove files
under the directory '.elmo/filter/' beforehand.

*** Searching of the NNTP folder is available
Now you can make NNTP filter folder.
(If only your NNTP server responds to XHDR command.)

** Session, Authentication

*** elmo-default-*-authenticate-type only accepts symbol(used be a string)
