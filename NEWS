Wanderlust NEWS -- User-visible changes in Wanderlust.

* Changes in 2.8.0 from 2.6.1

** Nemacs, Mule 2.3 based on Emacs 19.28 are no longer supported.

** Wanderlust might not work with FLIM 1.14.2 and older.
   It is recommended to use FLIM 1.14.3 or newer and associated SEMI.

** Added new type of folders: shimbun folder

   Format: '@' 'virtual server name' '.' 'group name'

** Added new type of folders: namazu folder

   Format:  '[' 'search condition' ']' [ 'absolute path of namazu index' ]

** Address manager is now available (start by C-c C-a).
   You can edit address book and import recipients to draft from it.

** ACAP (RFC2244) is supported(experimental).

** Now you can preserve IMAP4 message by part as a cache.
   If you skipped enormous part, you can read other than skipped part when
   you are off line.

** Wanderlust also creates message view through prefetching.
   Displaying of prefetched messages speeded up because of this.

** Truncation of lines in message buffer or draft buffer is now controllable.
   Non-nil value of wl-message-truncate-lines or wl-draft-truncate-lines
   means truncating long lines at window width.

** Overall elmo module are rewritten.

** Variables depending on elmo backends are renamed to "elmo-backend-*".
   e.g. elmo-default-imap4-server is renamed to elmo-imap4-default-server.

** Variables named xxx-func are renamed to xxx-function.

** Wanderlust distinguishes stream-type on plugged mode. They are treated as
   different entries.

** msgdb path for archive and multi folders are changed.
   No problem for running wanderlust even if you do not deal with them.
   But if you don't want to leave useless data on the disk, delete under
   .elmo/multi and .elmo/archive in advance.

** If you set obsolete variables (e.g. renamed ones), Wanderlust shows warning
   messages and urge you to change settings.
   To suppress warning messages, set elmo-obsolete-variable-show-warnings to
   nil.

** Variables named xxx-dir are renamed to xxx-directory.
   e.g. wl-icon-dir is renamed to wl-icon-directory.
   Take attention if you set for display of startup logo, etc.

** elmo-cache-dirname is abolished and elmo-cache-directory is newly created.
   You can put cache directory to another place by setting
   elmo-cache-directory (e.g. for whom put symbolic link for ~/.elmo/cache
   on NFS environment).

* Changes in 2.6.0 from 2.4.1.

** FLIM 1.13.x is not supported any longer.
   Please install FLIM 1.14.1 or later.

** Now folder and summary buffer can be opened in a separate frame.
   If `wl-folder-use-frame' is set as t, `M-x wl' creates a new frame
   for folder mode. If `wl-summary-use-frame' is set as t, new frames
   are created for each summary window.

** Cursor moving speed ('N' or 'P' in summary) is greatly improved.

** Folder checking speed for filter folder of localdir
   folder using `last' or `first' (Ex. /last:100/+inbox) is improved.

** Retrieval progress of each message is displayed in POP and IMAP folder.

** Coloring of summary buffer is processed on demand (only on Emacs).
   If `wl-summary-lazy-highlight' is non-nil, 
   only visible portion of the buffer is colored.

** Customizable biff notify.
   New hook `wl-biff-notify-hook' and `wl-biff-unnotify-hook' is
   now available.
   e.g. (add-hook wl-biff-notify-hook 'ding)

** Many bug fixes.

* Version 2.4.1 is basically a bug fix version of 2.4.0.

** Wanderlust 2.4.1 now works on FLIM 1.14.x. 

** Fixed a problem that POP connection remains after POP before SMTP.

** The specification of IMAP4 authentication method for clear password
   is changed.

In 2.4.0, To use clear password authentication method in IMAP4
(Logging in with LOGIN command), you have to set the variable
`elmo-default-imap4-authenticate-type' as 'plain (or nil).
But in 2.4.1, it is changed to 'clear (or nil).
Example:
(setq elmo-default-imap4-authenticate-type 'plain)
should be changed to
(setq elmo-default-imap4-authenticate-type 'clear)

* Changes in 2.4.0 from 1.1.1.

** Version Number
The version numbering convention for Wanderlust is changed. 

In earlier versions, 1.x were stable version and from 2.0.x to 2.2.x
were beta version. But since version 2.3.0, the second (minor) version
number implies the stability of the Wanderlust. Even minor number
corresponds to a stable version, and an odd minor number corresponds
to a development version. This version numbering is based on the
widespread convention of open source development.

On the open CVS server cvs.m17n.org, main trunk contains the current
beta (newest experimental) version, and branches contain the stable
version.  (If the version is 2.4.x, the branch name is wl-2_4)

** Install

See the file INSTALL for details.

*** APEL 10.2 or later is required.
tm-8 users should check the version of APEL (tm-8.8 contains old APEL).

If the variable wl-use-ldap is non-nil, LDAP feature is enabled

Caution for those who upgrade from 1.1.1:
By this change, saving directory for the msgdb of filter folder is altered.

if you don't want to keep useless disk, you should remove files
