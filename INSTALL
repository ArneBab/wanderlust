Required environment
====================

  Before installing Wanderlust, please install either of the following
  MIME modules. SEMI is recommended because it's more functional.

	SEMI    (1.14.1 or later)
	tm      (8.7 or later)

  If you use Mule based on Emacs 19.28 or earlier, please install tm.
  SEMI does not support Emacs 19.28 or earlier.

  SEMI only supports relatively new Emacsen like Emacs 20.xx, XEmacs, etc.
  But Mule based on Emacs 19.34 can also run SEMI.
  See the following web page to get more information (in Japanese).

	http://www.jpl.org/elips/INSTALL-SEMI-ja.html


(a) SEMI

  SEMI requires APEL and FLIM packages.
  Recommended combination of APEL, FLIM and SEMI are:

	APEL 10.3, FLIM 1.14.3 and SEMI 1.14.3

  You can download these packages from following URLs.

	APEL:     ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/
	FLIM:     ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/flim/
	SEMI:     ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/semi/

  Please install APEL, FLIM, and SEMI, in that order.
  Generally, 'make install' will do the job.
  To get full information, please refer to the README.en within each package.

  You can also use many other FLIM/SEMI variants.
  Combination of the latest versions should work.
  For example, the following combinations are confirmed to work:

	APEL 10.2, Chao 1.14.1, REMI 1.14.2
	APEL 10.2, SLIM 1.14.3, EMY 1.13.9

(b) tm

  The tm, whose version is 8.7 or later, is recommended.  Please
  obtain from the following web site.

	http://cvs.m17n.org/tomo/comp/emacsen/tm/tm-8/

  To get full information, please refer README.en within package.

  tm-8.8 or earlier makes following error while compiling Wanderlust.

	Use tm-8.x with APEL 10.2 or later.

  In this case, please install APEL 10.2 or later.

	APEL:     ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/


Installation
============

(a) Edit Makefile

  Edit EMACS, LISPDIR, and so on in Makefile.

	EMACS      Emacs command name.
	LISPDIR    site-lisp directory.

  If LISPDIR is not specified (or NONE by default), it is automatically
  detected.

(b) Bytecompile and Install

  Please do following.

	% make
	% make install

  If you use Emacs without subdirs.el (e.g. Mule 2.3 based on Emacs
  19.28), the following error message ocasinally appears.

	Cannot open load file: mime-setup

  In this case, add directories of custom, APEL, FLIM, SEMI to
  EMACSLOADPATH (environment variable), or add those directories to
  load-path in WL-CFG.


Install as a XEmacs package
===========================

  Wanderlust is able to be installed as one of XEmacs (21.0 or later)
  packages.  After installation as a XEmacs package, you do not need
  configurations of autoload, icon path in your own .emacs file.

(a) Edit Makefile

  Edit XEMACS, PACKAGEDIR, and so on in Makefile.

	XEMACS      XEmacs command name.
	PACKAGEDIR  package directory.

  If PACKAGEDIR is not specified (NONE by default) and the SEMI
  modules have been installed, it is automatically detected.

(b) Bytecompile and Install

  Please do following.

	% make package
	% make install-package

  Install with Info file.


load-path
=========

  If you are using Emacs 20.3 or later, or XEmacs, there is no need
  to set load-path.

  If you are using Emacs 20.2 or earlier, please add the directory of
  Wanderlust to load-path.

  If you install by default setting, with Emacs 19.29 or later, Emacs
  20.1, or Emacs 20.2, you can write subdirs.el for example:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
    (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path
     '("apel" "flim" "semi" "wl"))
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you are using Emacs 19.28 or earlier, you can't use subdirs.el.
  Please write setting about load-path in site configuration file.


Manual
======

  Manual is described in Info format. Please do following.

	% make info
	% make install-info

  If you install Wanderlust as a XEmacs package, Info file is already
  installed too, so there are no need of these commands.

  Manual directory is automatically detected. Of course, it can be
  configured by INFODIR in Makefile.


Sample configuration file
=========================

  Wanderlust requires the following three configuration files:

	~/.addresses    Address Book
	~/.folders      Folder Book
	~/.wl           Wanderlust Configuration (loaded at startup)

  Each sample file (dot.addresses, dot.folders, dot.wl) exists on
  samples/en/ directory. Please refer to them.

  To get full information, please read Info file.
